StackOverflow Reputation Builder
Thinkful StackOverflow Reputation Builder App

Thinkful Project Directions:

In this assignment, you will write the code that will bring the second feature online. The second feature for this page will give users the ability to search for the top StackOverflow answerers for particular topics. You already have the code for the HTML form, but in this assignment you'll need to add code to app.js that handles user requests for inspiration.

To clarify, the requirements for this feature are:

Users can submit a topic they want to find top answerers for on Stack Overflow.
The app makes an AJAX call to the appropriate endpoint on the StackExchange API (there are a few hints below).
The DOM is updated with information about top answerers (if any) after the response is returned.
